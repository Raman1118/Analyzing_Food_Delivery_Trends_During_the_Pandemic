# Analyzing_Food_Delivery_Trends_During_the_Pandemic
Problem Description ::
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about many changes in the way people live their lives, including how they obtain food. With many restaurants closing their doors or operating at limited capacity, food delivery services have seen a surge in demand. In this project, we aim to analyze food delivery trends during the COVID-19 pandemic using the Grubhub dataset available on Kaggle.
Objectives : 

The main objective of this project is to analyze food delivery trends during the COVID-19 pandemic and gain insights into how the pandemic has affected the food delivery industry. Specifically, we aim to:
 Identify the most popular types of cuisine ordered for delivery during the pandemic
 Analyze the change in demand for food delivery services before and during the pandemic
 Identify the most popular times of day for ordering food during the pandemic
